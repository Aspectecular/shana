            <p class = "text"> I KNEW YOU LOVED ME MAMAMA!! Merry Christmas baby, everything in the world does not ever compare the level of love and comfort and happiness you give me. You deserve everything in the world and I'm gonna always try to give you that. Thank you for always being there with me and even just talking to me, you have impacted my life in so many different ways. I can never pay you back for that but what I can do is treat you like the actual princess you are baby. I never told you this but deadass on my shitty days you always make it better by just talking to me. You aren't just my girlfriend, your my best friend and my future wife. I could not ask for anyone better than you, litterally everything you have is perfect to me. You already know I like your body but that's not the most important thing to me. I love the way you match my energy or the way you can handle my sarcasm. You are litterally my twin, and somehow we are dating.  I know that we are dating but I still like-like you, I still die inside when someone talks about you and I stal you social media like I already haven't seen everything. I still talk about you to my best friends and family and everyday you suprise me that you like me too. For that reason we will never fucking break up, and never cheating on eachother. And Shana I have to apologize for all th times I've been petty and mad at you I get jealous alot and overthink alot but I trust you so much. I will be forever grateful for your presence in my life as you have changed me in so many ways I love you so much and forever will. I appreciate the way you make sure to listen to me whenever I tell you too. I love when you eat on time or do your homework. I love the way you do your hair, or the way you do your makeup on the morning. I couldn't ask god for anyone better than you. And final thing, I know you say no and stuff when I say this but your actually the most beautiful and gorgeous women ever and like I'd be lucky to ever have you AND I AM plus you'd be the best mother of my kids. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH PRINCESSA YOUR THE BEST ‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è. - I just really want you to know that you mean everything to me and that I dearly love you alot. Merry Christmas my love üéÑ‚ùÑÔ∏èüéÖ
